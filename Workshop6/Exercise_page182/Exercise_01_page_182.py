Problem:

    1.  In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?

* * * * * ============================================================================================= * * * * *

Solution:
    Result:
        -   The first priority point is to approach solving problems with clean, neat, easy to read and
            understand code. The disadvantage of binding is the high-level memory (stack) Stack as explained
            above.
        -   Although the top-down design has the advantage that we will not have to worry about the problem
            of Stack overflow. But it also has a disadvantage compared to recursion that the processing code
            will be longer and more complex.
