Problem:

    2.  Describe the processes of top-down design and stepwise refinement. Where does the design start, and how
        does it proceed?

Solution:
    Result:
        1.  A problem might be difficult to solve as it stands. So you try to break it down into a set of smaller
            problems which might be solved more easily. This represents the first step of the process.
        2.  You then take the smaller problems, one at a time, and break them down into still smaller problems.
        3.  You keep repeating this process of breaking the problems down until all the problems facing you are
            small enough to handle.

        =>  Top-down design involves looking at the whole task and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable
            sub-problems which are easier to solve.  These sub-problems can be divided even further into smaller
            steps. This is called stepwise refinement.
            When this is complete an algorithm is produced which is a sequence of instructions that can be used to
            solve the task.
