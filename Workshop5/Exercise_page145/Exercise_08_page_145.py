* * * * * ============================================================================================= * * * * *

Solution:
    Result:
        -   The object identity is meant for a situation where the structure of the object is not encapsulated.
            Here, the 2 objects are meant to be in the same object based on having the identical properties.
        -   Structural equivalence is meant for extending the 2 specified nodes which are connected to the similar
            social environment which is hypothesized for the structural equivalence nodes.
