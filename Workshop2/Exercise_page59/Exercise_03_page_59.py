Problem:
    3.  Explain how to display a directory of all of the functions in a given module.

Solution:
    -   The first thing we have to do is import the os module.
    -   After you import the os module, then we pass the os module into the dir() function. This outputs all of the
        attributes and functions of the os module.
    -   This prints out all of the attributes and functions of the os module.
        You can see there are functions such as listdir, mkdir, makedirs, etc. This creates attributes such as name, path, etc...
        And this is how to list all functions, attributes, and classes of a module in Python.
