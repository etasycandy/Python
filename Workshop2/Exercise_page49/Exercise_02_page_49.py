Problem:
    2.  Explain the differences between the data types int and float.

Solution:
    *   Difference:
        -   int = Integer type: is a number without a decimal point.
        -   float = Real number type: is the number with the decimal part after the floating point.
        *   Floats are used when more precision is needed.
