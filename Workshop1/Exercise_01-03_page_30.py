Problem:
    1.  Suppose your script attempts to print the value of a variable that has not yet been
        assigned a value. How does the Python interpreter react?

    2.  Miranda has forgotten to complete an arithmetic expression before the end of a line
        of code. How will the Python interpreter react?

    3.  Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other
        programming languages?

Solution:

    1.  Python interpreter halts the execution & error message.

    2.  It would tell her that an indentation is unexpected.

    3.  Python's syntax generally allows the programmer to accomplish the programming
        language in fewer steps, but it does take longer to run the program.
