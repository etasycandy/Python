Solution:
    --> Display: "  >>> num = int(input("Number is: "))
                    Number is: >? 5
                    >>> print(num + 1)
                    6 "
    --> Explain:    After adding 1 to that number, it gives result is that number plus 1 unit.
                    Because, value num of integer type. So when add 1 to that number then computer will
                    understand that "it has to do the math to add 1 unit to that number".
