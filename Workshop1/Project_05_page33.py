Problem:
    5.  Modify the program of Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the appropriate prompts
        for the triangleâ€™s base and height, and change the names of the variables appropriately.
        Then, use the formula .5 * base * height to compute the area. Test the program from an IDLE window.

Solution:
    --> Display: "  Enter with base: 12
                    Enter with height: 6
                    The area is 360 triangular units. "

base = int(input("Enter with base: "))
height = int(input("Enter with height: "))
area = 5 * base * height
print("The area is", area, "triangular units.")
