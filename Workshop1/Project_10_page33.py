                    Welcome to Python 3.8's help utility!
                    If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
                    the tutorial on the Internet at https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/.

                    Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
                    Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
                    return to the interpreter, just type "quit".

                    To get a list of available modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, type
                    "modules", "keywords", "symbols", or "topics".  Each module also comes
                    with a one-line summary of what it does; to list the modules whose name
                    or summary contain a given string such as "spam", type "modules spam".

                     >? modules

                    Please wait a moment while I gather a list of all available modules...

                    You are now leaving help and returning to the Python interpreter.
                    If you want to ask for help on a particular object directly from the
                    interpreter, you can type "help(object)".  Executing "help('string')"
                    has the same effect as typing a particular string at the help> prompt.
