Solution:

    1.  Python shell error message:
        File "<input>", line 1
            Greetings!
                     ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    2.  name = str(input("Enter your name: "))

    3.  It's a language that Python already knows,
        so when certain words are input into Python like "int" Python already knows the significance of "int".

    4.  When a Python program is executed, it is translated into byte code.
        This byte code is then sent to the Python virtual machine (PVM) for further interpretation and execution.
