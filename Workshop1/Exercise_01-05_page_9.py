Problem:
    1.  List two examples of input devices and two examples of output devices.

    2.  What does the central processing unit (CPU) do?

    3.  How is information represented in hardware memory?

    4.  What is the difference between a terminal-based interface and a graphical user interface?

    5.  What role do translators play in the programming process?

Solution:

    1.  -> Input devices: Keyboard, Mouse
        -> Output devices: Screen, Printer

    2.
        -   The Central processing unit executes the instructions that are describe by algorithms.
        -   A major hardware component that consists of the arithmetic/logic unit and the control unit.
            Also sometimes called a processor.

    3.  Information is stored in the hardware memory and is represented in binary digits.
        Input and output devices transmit the information from the memory to the external world.

    4.
        -   A terminal-based interface accepts inputs from a keyboard and displays text output on a monitor screen.
        -   A graphical user interface (GUI) organizes the monitor screen around the metaphor of a desktop,
            with windows containing icons for folders, files, and applications.

    5.
        -   The translator converts high-level program code into executable code.
        -   Definition: A program that converts a program written in one language to an equivalent program
            in another language.
