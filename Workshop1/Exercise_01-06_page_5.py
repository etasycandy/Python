Problem:
    1.  List three common types of computing agents.

    2.  Write an algorithm that describes the second part of the process of making change
        (counting out the coins and bills).

    3.  Write an algorithm that describes a common task, such as baking a cake or operating a DVD player.

    4.  Describe an instruction that is not well defined and thus could not be included as a
        step in an algorithm. Give an example of such an instruction.

    5.  In what sense is a laptop computer a general-purpose problem-solving machine?

    6.  List four devices that use computers and describe the information that they process.
        (Hint: Think of the inputs and outputs of the devices.)

Solution:

    1.  Input, Output, CPU

    2.  ...

    3.  Write an algorithm to solve the problem of finding the largest number in a given sequence of numbers.
        <<
        - Step 1: Choose any number in array as landmark.
            < Set case: The first value in the array as the landmark >
        - Step 2: Browser each element of the array & compare with landmark.
        - Step 3:
            1: If the value just browsed bigger than landmark then assign that value to landmark.
            2: Else will keep the landmark value.
        - Step 4: Print the work results to the screen
        >>

    4.  Ex: "Describe 'Modular math'"
        -   In the modulo operation is the operation to find the remainder of the division of two numbers
            (sometimes called modulus ).
        -   Suppose: We default a is divisor & n is dividend
        -   When either a or n is negative, the basic definition is broken and thus could not be included as a
            step in an algorithm. As well as the definition of these results.

    5.  Since a smartwatch tells the time and can do a few calculations, it is a laptop that is a general-purpose
        problem-solving machine because it can perform various tasks. common goal in many computer programs.
        It is a computer, it can open a web browser to solve problems (emergency system), download new information,
        etc...

    6.  Four devices that use computers:
        -   Smartwatches: uses the input from the touchscreen to output appropriate apps to measure workouts.
        -   Digital multimeter: receives the input circuit which gives a digital display of the amount of volts
            from the circuit.
        -   Computer has a keyboard that outputs letters, numbers, and symbols to the appropriate key.
        -   Insulin pump inputs of certain buttons allows the machine to deliver proper amounts of insulin.
